# M&A Deal Filters in SDC Platinum

We downloaded the M&A deal data from SDC Platinum on a licensed computer at Firestone Library. As the database is very comprehensive, we need to find a reasonable set of filters useful for our specific tasks. 

The general rule is to download as reasonably large a dataset as possible from the library computer, and then further clean it on our own PCs. This will save the time back and forth between Firestone and Sherrerd Hall.
